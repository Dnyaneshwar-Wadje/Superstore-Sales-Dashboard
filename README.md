# 📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

Hi there! 👋  
This project is a Power BI dashboard I built using the popular **Superstore dataset**. It’s designed to explore key business metrics like **sales**, **profit**, and **quantity** across different categories, segments, and regions.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- **Sales Overview** – Includes sales performance by **year**, **state and region**, and a detailed view of **sales by sub-category and category**. It’s easy to spot top-performing states like California and high-revenue products like Phones.

- **Profit Overview** – Tracks profit across **regions and customer segments**, with time-based breakdowns by **year, quarter, month, and day**. You’ll also find a detailed matrix of **subcategory-level profit across regions**, giving you a clear view of what’s driving profitability (and where losses occur).

- **Quantity Overview** – Shows the **total quantity sold by month and segment**, as well as an overall view by **category**. A great way to understand product movement trends and seasonal patterns.

- **Q&A Section** – An interactive area where you can ask natural questions like “What is the profit ratio by city?” or “Top states by profit ratio” and get instant visual answers powered by Power BI’s AI engine.

- All visuals are interactive and designed to help uncover insights quickly — from high-level trends to granular product-level details.
